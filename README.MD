# Blocks of Data

An opensource in-development entity-based internal block-stacking engine. It's focus is on high performance and low amount of memory allocated per player.

# Notice

This is not a complete ECS game.
It's not built on top of Johnny Turbo's LD43. Foundation of blocks_of_data is: Unity DOTS.
This could theoretically work on Unity 2021+.
